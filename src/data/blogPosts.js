      'Practical strategies to boost your performance during coding interviews, from problem breakdown to communication.',
    content: `
### 1. Understand the problem deeply
Before writing code, rephrase the problem in your own words and walk through examples. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous.

### 2. Share your thought process
Interviewers aren’t just grading the final answer—they’re evaluating how you think. Talk through your approach as you code.

### 3. Start with a simple solution
Get a brute‑force version working first, then refactor for efficiency. Early progress builds confidence and shows progress.

### 4. Consider edge cases and test
Think about empty inputs, large values, or invalid data. Write a few manual tests before submitting your solution.

### 5. Practice consistently
Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or our own practice pages to build muscle memory. Regular practice reduces anxiety on the big day.
